This course explores different topics in
Gravitation Physics, General Relativity, and
Cosmology based on current frontier
developments in the field that a student
pursuing Phd degree in modern astrophysics
and Cosmology must know, including the
shadows of ultracompact objects at the center of
the galaxies and the accretion discs around the
same. Particularly, this course focuses on
Causality Theory, Differentiable Manifolds,
Topology in Cosmology, Tetrad Formalism in
Black hole Physics, Gravitational Collapse and
Gravitational Waves, Photon Spheres around
compact objects, Spacetime Singularities and
their genericity and stability and other relevant
topics. In addition, numerical techniques and
simulations to solve problems in gravitation
physics will be introduced.
